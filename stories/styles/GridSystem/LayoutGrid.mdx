# Grid System

This is the global responsive grid system for this project. The default
grid settings for this project are as follows:

* **12 columns** default, then **8 and 4 columns** below the `md` and `sm` breakpoints respectively
* **24px gutters**
* **96** at and above the `md` breakpoint
* **20px margin** below the `sm` breakpoint
* **1174px max width containers**

>**NB!** The layout grid is not a React component, but is instead created via Sass mixins.
All of Aleph's standard mixins [are documented here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aleph/nought-sass-mixins).


## Grid Containers

A standard grid, constrained by the `container` max width.
```scss
@include grid;
@include container;

// helper mixin for combining both
@include containerGrid;
```
<Canvas of={LayoutGridStories.Grid} />

## Column Mixins

Elements can span columns on the grid a few different ways with mixins. Note that, 
by default, any elements using these mixins will expand to span the full width of
the grid at the smallest breakpoint. This can be overridden in the mixin itself. 

Note the following three elements, using the code below to render:

```scss
.span-6 {
  @include spanColumns(6, 3);
}

.span-7 {
  @include columns(5, 12);

  @include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
    @include columns(2, -1);
  }
}

.span-full {
  @include columns(1, -1);
}
```
